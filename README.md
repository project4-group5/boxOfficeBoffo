Box Office Boffo is a web game that allows users to guess the top-grossing movies of a chosen year. Users can select from a list of the 20 highest grossing movies of their chosen year and rank them. once they have their list they can lock in their selections and share their ranking with their friends to compare scores. The app uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) as its data source.
